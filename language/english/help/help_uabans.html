    <h4 class="odd">UA Bans</h4>
	<br/>
	<p>It is possible to automatically exclude certain players from authenticating to a stream based upon their reported user agent.  This is a useful capability to have as many stream rippers and other unsavory tools tune in with known user agents.</p>
	<p>The filtering approach can be referred to the "needle in the haystack".  This is a simple text search where if a full reported user agent contains the needle, then the ban takes effect.  Be aware that the search is a simple match and intelligent UA filtering is not available at this point.</p>
	<p>As a simple example, configuring the needle of <i>ripper</i> in the UA needle, any UA reporting <i>ripper</i> anywhere in the string of the user agent will be denied connection to the given stream.  Accordingly, adding <i>Mozilla</i> as a UA needle would deny stream access to virtually all browsers.  Please use this feature carefully.</p>
