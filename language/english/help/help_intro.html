    <br/>
	<p>This module provides a URL authentication facility to IceCast servers running 2.3.2 and higher.</p>
	<br/>
    <p>The feature functionality is achieved in a client/server manner where requests originating from an IceCast server are checked against a defined set of mount points.  In addition to allowing or disallowing a streaming session, the module is capable of pushing out intro files as well as imposing time limits on the stream before a client needs to connect again.</p>
    <p>In addition to authentication, the module is capable of performing a rudimentary set of accounting.  This provides a basic level of accounting for TTSL (total time spent listening), as well as the user agents which connect into the system.</p>
    <p>Help topics related to the module are listed towards the left.  These cover a number of the tabs which make up the module functions.  This section will be built out and filled in over time.</p>
