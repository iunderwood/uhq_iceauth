==[ Known Issues ]==

* Preview player goes into "error" after the clip is done.
* Preview player does not work in Chrome, Opera, or Safari.  I will not be testing IE.
* Modifying mountpoint key data (ip/port/mount) does not update log information.  This isn't a real "issue", but a conversion utility might be nice.

==[ To-Do ]==

* Limit concurrent listener logins for authenticated streams.
* Admin/Accounting: Add columns to include pass/fail counters.
* Add capability to allow variable mountpoint times based on user permissions.
* Capability to update MIME types through the module if any are missing.
* Module: Continue improvements to DB failure reporting.
* Module: Add capability to display who is listening right now across all mountpoints.  Live snapshot required as log data is not necessarily reliable.
* Module: IP Bans, fails users whose IPs fall into a given range.
* Module: Store IPs with a numberic value instead of their friendly version.
* Module: IP Bans should cover IPv6 as well.
